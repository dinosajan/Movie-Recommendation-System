Movie Recommendation System

Project Overview
This is a Python-based dataset-driven Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences and similarity of attributes inside a CSV dataset. The system does not use Machine Learning models. Recommendations are generated using filtering and data analysis techniques applied to the dataset provided by the user.

Features
• Reads movie information from CSV files
• Suggests movies based on similarity of genres, ratings and attributes
• Works fully using data filtering
• Developed using Python and basic data manipulation logic

Technologies Used
• Programming Language: Python
• Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
• Dataset Format: CSV files (movies.csv, ratings.csv)

Project Files
• movie_recommender.py – Main Python program
• movies.csv – Dataset containing movie titles, genres, etc.
• ratings.csv – Dataset containing rating information

How to Run
1. Install Python 3
2. Install required libraries if needed (pandas, numpy)
3. Run the program: python movie_recommender.py
4. Upload or provide the dataset when prompted
5. The system will display recommended movies based on dataset attributes

Dataset Source
The dataset contains publicly available movie metadata and is suitable for academic learning and educational purposes.

Skills Demonstrated
• Python programming
• CSV data handling
• Data filtering and analysis
• Logical recommendation techniques without ML
• Implementation of a real academic project
